# Library Card App

Longwood Public Library: Library Card Database

While I was working in IT for LPL, my boss knew that I was a programmer and asked if I could overhaul their library card system, as they we're still using paper applications and filing all of these applications as they came in. I made this website in C#/ASP.NET and used some Ajax/JS, it used an API that scraped the patron's information from our book rental system using their barcode number, allowed the patron to sign and confirm their correct information, and store their "library card" into a searchable database.

Unfortunately before I was able to deploy this I had gotten a new job, and although this was finished and ready to deploy I didn't want to deploy and then leave them with nobody to maintain the application, as I was the only programmer employed.
